              <p>The Bottlenose interacts with an implanted magnet by taking in a large range of data such as sonar, UV, Wi-Fi, or thermal information and translates it to a magnetic field via induction.</p>
              <p>Grindhouse Wetware also provides a haptic version of the Bottlenose, which does not require a magnet implant. The haptic model vibrates with varying intensity in the presence of sensory information. Any sensor can be substituted or added to the provided kit. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/voGVwniAL7Y" class="biolink" target="_blank">Instructions on how this is done are provided in this video.</a></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Grindhouse Wetware </span>was founded January 2012, by what was then a rag tag group of programmers, engineers, and enthusiasts. In the short five months that followed, Grindhouse evolved from a group of highly driven individuals on the <a class="biolink" href="http://discuss.biohack.me/" target="_blank">biohack.me</a> forums, to a dedicated team working towards a common goal - augmenting humanity using <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">safe, affordable, open source</span> technology.</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">"What would you like to be today?" </span>Grindhouse hardware and software are designed with the hacker in mind. The hardware and software are open source, which allows the user to reconfigure code, add on or take off sensors, and generally explore. Though all hardware can be purchased from the Grindhouse website, all schematics for our implants and cyberware are open source - the user can either use our schematics to build their custom model from scratch, or purchase our model with a breakout board to get started.</p>
                <p>There are many excellent organizations that are doing very important financial and scientific work for transhumanism. The groundwork for the technology and science we use has been in existence for decades, it is not nanotechnology or advanced Synthetic biology (the technologies that most excite futurists), but anatomy, electrical engineering, and programming. At Grindhouse we firmly believe that with<span> imagination and drive,</span> any of us can feel and touch EMF fields, explore its contours, sense the temperature of objects across a room, navigate a room using a sonar sense, or even connect your body to the Internet - <span style="font-weight: bold;">right now.</span> It is that dream above all that drives us to create.</p>

              <div id="accordion">
                <h3>Where can I learn more or get involved with biohacking?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p> Please visit the <a href="http://biohack.me" target="_blank">biohack.me</a> forums if you are interested in joining the community. It is a greater collective and many experienced hackers are active. They would be able to help you with questions or ideas that you might have! </p>
                </div>
                <h3> What does the magnet feel like? </h3>
                <div>
                  <p>“Honestly, the only thing I found to kinda describe the magnetic fields is like reaching your hand through a chinchilla. Impossibly soft and fuzzy. Like a cloud of invisible fluff!” - Jes Waldrip
                    “It has a soft vibrating feeling within your finger. It can be surprising when you stick your hand somewhere you don’t expect a field, but you get used to the sensation.” - Justin Worst
                    The feeling will vary from person to person though, from variations in magnets and shapes and coatings to biological variations between people.   </p>
                  </div>
                  <h3> What about MRIs? </h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>We know a number of people who have MRIs without any issues. That being said, MRIs come in a variety of strengths, this is something you should talk to your doctor about before getting an MRI. (If you're concerned about an involuntary MRI, a tattoo or medical bracelet is an option. Or see if you can have a note made on your health records.)</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>What’s the point of Northstar? That seems like a lot of effort for simple lights</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>It was a lot of effort! But although the end product is just a light, we gained a lot from the Northstar project. We learned how to make a safe implant that can survive in the body, how to work as a team, and how to work with other companies. We learned the minutia of mass production and corporate finance. These are all things we need to know before we can tackle bigger projects.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Did it hurt?</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Pain management is something that is left up to the individual implanters and not part of the process we are involved in. However, this is definitely not a pain-free procedure. </p></div>
                    <h3>Does the implant get in the way?</h3>
                    <div><p>Several people who are involved in several different sports and activities have had implants, so we can safely say that an active lifestyle is totally viable with implanted devices.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Any run-ins with the TSA?</h3>
                    <div><p>Magnets and chips tend to pass through airport security just fine, however some of our members opt for the ‘freedom fondle’ to avoid any issues. Your mileage may vary.</p></div>
                    <h3>Can the government use this tech to spy on us?</h3>
                    <div><p>Northstar V1 does not contain any wireless or tracking technologies, so it cannot be used to spy on anyone. More importantly, everything we make is open source. This means you can download all the schematics and software, and ensure your device isn't being used against you.</p>
                      <p>Once you have purchased a Grindhouse device, it's yours. You have the right to know what it's made of and how it works, to decide who it talks to, and what happens to it's data. You are allowed to modify the implant, software and supporting infrastructure to accomplish this, although we don't recommend it.</p></div>
                      <h3>Why can't Northstar V1 be recharged?</h3>
                      <div><p>Northstar V1 is not just a simple implant- it's the simplest possible powered implant. This meant that if anything went wrong it would be easy and cheap to fix. Don't worry, all the other implants we make will be rechargeable.</p></div>

                      <h3>What happens when the battery dies?</h3>
                      <div><p>It is safe to leave the implant in after it has run out of power. If you do get it removed, it is possible to replace or upgrade the implant in the same surgery.</p></div>

                      <h3>Can it be used to help “disabled” people?</h3>
                      <div><p>Grindhouse technology and the benefits it may provide are universal. Human enhancement technology blurs the concept of disability. You couldn't feel electric fields before you got a magnet, but you weren't considered disabled, even though plenty of people have that ability now. Rather than trying to bring disabled people to an arbitrary standard of ability, we want everyone to be able to do whatever they want.</p> </div>
